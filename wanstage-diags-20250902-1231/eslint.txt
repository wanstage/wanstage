ESLint: 9.34.0

A configuration object specifies rule "prettier/prettier", but could not find plugin "prettier".

Common causes of this problem include:

1. The "prettier" plugin is not defined in your configuration file.
2. The "prettier" plugin is not defined within the same configuration object in which the "prettier/prettier" rule is applied.
